Notes:
- imix is deprecated use imixv2 for all changes
- before committing run `cargo fmt` in the realm/implants directory.
- Use `realm/bin` for crates that need to exist outside the workspace to avoid circurlar dependencies when working with build.rs

Task:
Build a crate for use in a build script in realm/bin that parses a YAML config to a struct.
Change grpc-doh from a compile time option to a runtime option parsed from the IMIX_CALLBACK_URI environment variable as a DSN using ? &
Update lib/pb/src/config.rs Config constructors to parse CALLBACK_URI as a list of callbacks from the YAML config file using `;` delimiter.

Validate the config for correct YAML and business logic rulses:
- server_pubkey must be a valid base64 string of length 44
- callbacks must have at least one entry
- each callback must have a valid type (grpc, http1, dns)
- each callback uri must be a valid URI according to its type
- interval and retry_interval must be positive integers
- if type is dns, domain and query_type must be present
- if type is grpc and doh is present, it must be either "cloudflare", "google", or "quad9"
- if type is grpc and doh is not present it should not be set.
- if type is grpc and proxy_uri is present, it must be a valid URI
- features must only contain valid features (grpc, http1, dns)
- run_once is optional if it's set to anything emit the environment variable as IMIX_RUN_ONCE=true
- ensure that both a config file and a legacy IMIX_CALLBACK_URI, IMIX_PROXY_URI, IMIX_CALLBACK_INTERVAL, IMIX_PROXY_URI environment variable are not set at the same time error if they are.

Use feature flags for conditional compilation and environment variables for compile time values.
Use the `assert_cmd` crate to write CLI tests for this new crate.
Write tests that validate the config parsing and business logic rules.
Test that the values in stdout match the expected build.rs diretctives.
Use this new crate in the imixv2 build.rs file to parse a YAML config from an environment variable (the full file should be passed instead of a file path to make this more container friednly).

Example YAML config:
```yaml
server_pubkey: "4RKWp9WVrVrEcaTQK7MuZHdFOlFg2pP33G4c7qFZGTQ="
interval: 5
retry_interval: 5

callbacks:
  - type: grpc
    uri: "http://localhost:8080"
    doh: cloudflare
    proxy_uri: "http://localhost:3128"
  - type: grpc
    uri: "https://localhost:8443"
    doh: google
  - type: http1
    uri: "https1://localhost:8443"
  - type: http1
    uri: "http1://localhost:8080"
  - type: dns
    uri: "dns://localhost:53"
    domain: "example.com"
    query_type: "TXT"

run_once: true

features:
  - grpc
  - http1
  - dns
```
