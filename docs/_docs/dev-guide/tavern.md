## Overview

Before reading this guide, please check out the [admin guide](/admin-guide/tavern) to better understand how Tavern is deployed and managed. If you would like to help contribute to Tavern, please take a look at our [open issues](https://github.com/spellshift/realm/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Atavern).

## GraphQL API

### Creating a New Model

1. Initialize the schema `cd tavern && go run entgo.io/ent/cmd/ent init <NAME>`
2. Update the generated file in `tavern/internal/ent/schema/<NAME>.go`
3. Ensure you include a `func (<NAME>) Annotations() []schema.Annotation` method which returns a `entgql.QueryField()` annotation to tell entgo to generate a GraphQL root query for this model (if you'd like it to be queryable from the root query)
4. Update `tavern/internal/graphql/gqlgen.yml` to include the ent types in the `autobind:` section (e.g.`- github.com/spellshift/realm/tavern/internal/ent/<NAME>`)
5. **Optionally** update the `models:` section of `tavern/internal/graphql/gqlgen.yml` to bind any GraphQL enum types to their respective `entgo` generated types (e.g. `github.com/spellshift/realm/tavern/internal/ent/<NAME>.<ENUM_FIELD>`)
6. Run `go generate ./tavern/...` from the project root
7. If you added an annotation for a root query field (see above), you will notice auto-generated the `query.resolvers.go` file has been updated with new methods to query your model (e.g. `func (r *queryResolver) <NAME>s ...`)
    * This must be implemented (e.g. `return r.client.<NAME>.Query().All(ctx)` where NAME is the name of your model)

### Adding Mutations

1. Update the `mutation.graphql` schema file to include your new mutation and please include it in the section for the model it's mutating if applicable (e.g. createUser should be defined near all the related User mutations)
    * **Note:** Input types such as `Create<NAME>Input` or `Update<NAME>Input` will already be generated if you [added the appropriate annotations to your ent schema](https://entgo.io/docs/tutorial-todo-gql#install-and-configure-entgql). If you require custom input mutations (e.g. `ClaimTasksInput`) then add them to the `inputs.graphql` file (Golang code will be generated in tavern/internal/graphql/models e.g. `models.ClaimTasksInput`).
2. Run `go generate ./...`
3. Implement generated the generated mutation resolver method in `tavern/internal/graphql/mutation.resolvers.go`
    * Depending on the mutation you're trying to implement, a one liner such as `return r.client.<NAME>.Create().SetInput(input).Save(ctx)` might be sufficient
4. Please write a unit test for your new mutation by defining YAML test cases in a new `testdata/mutations` subdirectory with your mutations name (e.g. `tavern/internal/graphql/testdata/mutations/mymutation/SomeTest.yml`)

### Code Generation Reference

* After making a change, remember to run `go generate ./...` from the project root.
* `tavern/internal/ent/schema` is a directory which defines our graph using database models (ents) and the relations between them
* `tavern/generate.go` is responsible for generating ents defined by the ent schema as well as updating the GraphQL schema and generating related code
* `tavern/internal/ent/entc.go` is responsible for generating code for the entgo <-> 99designs/gqlgen GraphQL integration
* `tavern/internal/graphql/schema/mutation.graphql` defines all mutations supported by our API
* `tavern/internal/graphql/schema/query.graphql` is a GraphQL schema automatically generated by ent, providing useful types derived from our ent schemas as well as root-level queries defined by entgo annotations
* `tavern/internal/graphql/schema/scalars.graphql` defines scalar GraphQL types that can be used to help with Go bindings (See [gqlgen docs](https://gqlgen.com/reference/scalars/) for more info)
* `tavern/internal/graphql/schema/inputs.graphql` defines custom GraphQL inputs that can be used with your mutations (e.g. outside of the default auto-generated CRUD inputs)

### YAML Test Reference (GraphQL)

|Field|Description|Required|
|-----|-----------|--------|
|state| SQL queries that define the initial db state before the query is run.| no |
|requestor| Holds information about the authenticated context making the query. | no |
|requestor.beacon_token| Session token corresponding to the user for authentication. You may create a user with a predetermined session token using the `state` field. | no |
|query| GraphQL query or mutation to be executed | yes |

## GRPC API

Tavern also supports a gRPC API for agents to claim tasks and report execution output. This API is defined by our c2.proto spec and is still under active development.

### Downloading Files

You may download files from Tavern utilizing the `DownloadFile` gRPC method. This method streams responses, each of which will contain a chunk of the desired file. We rely on the [ordering guarantees](https://grpc.io/docs/languages/go/basics/#defining-the-service) provided by gRPC to ensure the file is assembled correctly. This API also sets two headers to ensure the integrity of files:

* `sha3-256-checksum`: Set to the SHA3 hash of the entire file.
* `file-size`: Set to the number of bytes contained by the file.

## Performance Profiling

Tavern supports built in performance monitoring and debugging via the Golang [pprof tool](https://go.dev/blog/pprof) developed by Google. To run tavern with profiling enabled, ensure the `ENABLE_PPROF=1` environment variable is set.

### Install Graphviz

Ensure you have an updated version of [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/about/) installed for visualizing profile outputs.

```bash
apt install -y graphviz
```

### Collect a Profile

1. Start Tavern with profiling enabled: `ENABLE_PPROF=1 go run ./tavern`.
2. Collect a Profile in desired format (e.g. png): `go tool pprof -png -seconds=10 http://127.0.0.1:80/debug/pprof/allocs?seconds=10 > .pprof/allocs.png`
    a. Replace "allocs" with the [name of the profile](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof#Profile) to collect.
    b. Replace the value of seconds with the amount of time you need to reproduce performance issues.
    c. Read more about the available profiling URL parameters [here](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof#hdr-Parameters).
    d. `go tool pprof` does not need to run on the same host as Tavern, just ensure you provide the correct HTTP url in the command. Note that Graphviz must be installed on the system you're running `pprof` from.
3. Reproduce any interactions with Tavern that you'd like to collect profiling information for.
4. A graph visualization of the requested performance profile should now be saved locally, take a look and see what's going on üïµÔ∏è.

## Agent Development

Tavern provides an HTTP(s) GraphQL API that agents may use directly to claim tasks and submit execution results. This is the standard request flow, and is supported as a core function of realm. To learn more about how to interface with GraphQL APIs, please read [this documentation](https://www.graphql.com/tutorials/#clients) or read on for a simple example.

This however restricts the available transport methods the agent may use to communicate with the teamserver e.g. only HTTP(s). If you wish to develop an agent using a different transport method (e.g. DNS), your development will need to include a C2. The role of the C2 is to handle agent communication, and translate the chosen transport method into HTTP(s) requests to Tavern's GraphQL API. This enables developers to use any transport mechanism with Tavern. If you plan to build a C2 for a common protocol for use with Tavern, consider [submitting a PR](https://github.com/spellshift/realm/pulls).

### GraphQL Example

GraphQL mutations enable clients to _mutate_ or modify backend data. Tavern supports a variety of different mutations for interacting with the graph ([see schema](https://github.com/spellshift/realm/blob/main/tavern/internal/graphql/schema/mutation.graphql)). The two mutations agents rely on are `claimTasks` and `submitTaskResult` (covered in more detail below). GraphQL requests are submitted as HTTP POST requests to Tavern, with a JSON body including the GraphQL mutation. Below is an example JSON body that may be sent to the Tavern GraphQL API:

```json
{
  "query": "mutation ClaimTasks($input: ClaimTasksInput!) {\n  claimTasks(input: $input) {\n    id\n  }\n}",
  "variables": {
    "input": {
      "principal": "root",
      "hostname": "test",
      "hostIdentifier": "dodo",
      "agentIdentifier": "bleep",
      "beaconIdentifier": "123"
    }
  },
  "operationName": "ClaimTasks"
}
```

In the above example, `$input` is used to pass variables from code to the GraphQL mutation while avoiding sketchy string parsing. Fields that should be present in the output are included in the body of the query (e.g. 'id').

### Claiming Tasks

The first GraphQL mutation an agent should utilize is `claimTasks`. This mutation is used to fetch new tasks from Tavern that should be executed by the agent. In order to fetch execution information, the agent should perform a graph traversal to obtain information about the associated quest. For example:

```graphql
mutation ClaimTasks($input: ClaimTasksInput!) {
  claimTasks(input: $input) {
    id
    quest {
      tome {
        id
        eldritch
      }
      bundle {
        id
      }
    }
  }
}
```

If the mutation returns a bundle, it should be fetched from the CDN to provide necessary assets (a tar.gz) for eldritch execution. The Task ID should be saved for later reporting results of task execution.

## Submitting Results

After task execution has been completed (or as it is being completed), an agent should utilize the `submitTaskResult` mutation to update Tavern with execution output and status information. When task execution is finished, the agent should provide a value for the `execFinishedAt` parameter. If a task fails to complete, the agent should provide a value for the `error` parameter.
