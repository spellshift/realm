## Getting Started

Welcome, intrepid red teamer! This guide will launch you into a sandboxed Realm experience, perfect for experimenting and exploring its features. Think of it as your personal training ground before unleashing it in real-world engagements. But first, let's make sure you're in the right place.

* Want to deploy Realm for production? Check out our [deployment guide](/admin-guide/tavern#deployment).
* Want to write new [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome)? Check out our [Tome guide](/user-guide/tomes).

Otherwise, let's delve into Realm! Break, bend, and explore to your heart's content. This is your chance to unlock Realm's potential and get comfortable before your next engagement. Time for an adventure!

### Tavern (C2 / Teamserver)

In the bustling world of Realm, the Tavern serves as your red team's central operations hub. It is your virtual war room, managing [Beacons](/user-guide/terminology#beacon), those carefully planted footholds within your target landscape. Think of them as listening posts, constantly relaying intel back to the Tavern and awaiting [Quests](/user-guide/terminology#quest).

But the Tavern is more than just a C2. Imagine it as a vast, ever-evolving map of the target environment, a knowledge graph meticulously built from collected data. It will help you navigate the terrain, identify vulnerabilities, and plan your next move with strategic precision. Remember, a well-stocked Tavern paves the way for successful campaigns!

To start Tavern, open a terminal and run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spellshift/realm.git
cd realm && go run ./tavern
```

The warnings you see here indicate that there are settings recommended for production environments that have not been configured. For now, it's safe to ignore these and continue on.

### Imix (Agent / Beacon)

[Imix](/user-guide/imix) is the supported [Agent](/user-guide/terminology#agent) for Realm. This fiery trickster resides within your target network, eagerly awaiting your commands whispered through magical [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome). These [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome), inspired by [MITRE ATT&CK tactics](https://attack.mitre.org/matrices/enterprise/), empower [Imix](/user-guide/imix) to scout, exploit weaknesses, and launch attacks against target systems.

```bash
# Assumes you have already cloned the repository and are in the 'realm' directory
cd ./implants/imix && cargo run
```

![starting-imix](/assets/img/user-guide/getting-started/starting-imix.png)

Here we run the `imix` [Agent](/user-guide/terminology#agent), and with this debug-mode, it will log information to keep you informed of its operations. When built for production, `imix` does not generate these logs (see [our imix guide](/user-guide/imix)).

You'll notice two key components of the configuration:

* `callback_uri` - Defines the URI for Tavern, where this [Beacon](/user-guide/terminology#beacon) should callback to.
* `interval` - Defines how often this [Beacon](/user-guide/terminology#beacon) should perform callbacks (in seconds).

These configurations can be controlled via Environment Variables at `imix` compile-time. See the [imix configuration docs](/user-guide/imix#configuration) for more information.

### Quests

Now it's time to provide our [Beacon](/user-guide/terminology#beacon) it's first [Task](/user-guide/terminology#task). We do this, by creating a [Quest](/user-guide/terminology#quest) in the UI, which represents a collection of [Tasks](/user-guide/terminology#task) across one or more [Hosts](/user-guide/terminology#host). Let's open our UI, which should be available at [http://127.0.0.1:80/](http://127.0.0.1:80/).

#### Beacon Selection

Now from the left navigation menu, select "Create new quest".

*Note: `Service + group` searches use `AND` while `service + service` or `group + group` searches use `OR`*

![create-new-quest](/assets/img/user-guide/getting-started/create-new-quest.png)

This view will show all of our active [Beacons](/user-guide/terminology#beacon) available for tasking. For now, simply select your creatively-named [Beacon](/user-guide/terminology#beacon) and click "Continue".

#### Tome Selection

A [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) is an [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) package ready for execution by `imix`. By default, Tavern includes several core [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) to get you started. But don't worry, for more customization and advanced capabilities, it's easy to write your own [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome)! These [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) are designed to be cross-platform, so it shouldn't matter which platform you're running on. You can view the underlying [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) code a [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) will run by clicking on the "details" dropdown. Feel free to take a minute to read through some of the core [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) available to you.

![select-tome](/assets/img/user-guide/getting-started/select-tome.png)

Let's select "hostname", which will simply print the hostname of the [Host](/user-guide/terminology#host) `imix` is running on. You may filter [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) using the search bar above. Certain [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) will allow / require you to specify parameters to inform their execution, which will be displayed in this step (for relevant [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome)). When you're ready, select "Continue".

#### Confirm and Submit

Lastly, we'll be greeted with a prompt displaying a summary of the [Quest](/user-guide/terminology#quest) you're about to launch. Check that everything looks correct, and click "Submit"!

![confirm-quest](/assets/img/user-guide/getting-started/confirm-quest.png)

#### Results

Now, in your `imix` logs you'll see that when it calls back, it will obtain the [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) from Tavern and evaluate it. On it's next callback, it will report the results.

![imix-tome-eval](/assets/img/user-guide/getting-started/imix-tome-eval.png)

By refreshing the UI (polling not yet supported), you should see the output is now available!

![quest-result](/assets/img/user-guide/getting-started/quest-result.png)

This concludes your initial foray into Realm, but the true adventure lies ahead. Having navigated this introduction, you now possess the foundational knowledge to embark on your red teaming journey with Realm.

**Remember:**

* **Craft Strategic Campaigns:** Leverage [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) to orchestrate Imix's actions, aligning them with your specific objectives.
* **Analyze and Adapt:** Use the ever-expanding knowledge graph to inform your decision-making and refine your attack strategy.
* **Harness the Community:** Engage with the growing Realm community to share knowledge, gain insights, and contribute to its evolution.

Farewell, adventurer, and may your [Quests](/user-guide/terminology#quest) with [Imix](/user-guide/imix) be fruitful and fiery!
