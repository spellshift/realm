## Terminology

Throughout the documentation terms that are used to reference various components of Realm. Below we attempt to define some of those terms, to add some clarity to that other documentation.

### Implant

References malicious code or persistence mechanisms that are deployed to compromise target systems. Imix is the primary implant used with Realm.

### Agent

An Agent is a type of implant which retrieves execution instructions by connecting to our backend infrastructure (calling back) and querying for new tasks.

### Beacon

A Beacon is an instance of an Agent running as a process. Beacons are the underlying unit that can be tasked with instructions to execute.

### Host

Hosts are in-scope systems for the current engagement. A host can have multiple beacons which can execute instructions provided by tomes.

### Quest

Quests enable multi-beacon managment by taking a list of beacons and executing a tome with customized parameters against them. A quest is made up of tasks assocaited with a single beacon.

### Task

A task is a single instance of a tome plus its parameters executed against a single beacon. For example, listing files could be a Task. When listing files across various Beacons, one Task per Beacon will be created for tracking the individual execution output.

### Eldritch

Eldritch is our Pythonic Domain Specific Language (DSL), which can be used to progammatically define red team operations. Many of the language's built-in features do not rely on system binaries. For more information, please see the [Eldritch section](/user-guide/eldritch) of the documentation.

### Tome

A Tome is a prebuilt Eldritch bundle, which includes execution instructions and embed files. Tomes are how beacon actions are defined and change their behavior at runtime. Tavern's built-in Tomes are defined [here](https://github.com/spellshift/realm/tree/main/tavern/tomes).
