## Overview

This section outlines some basic usage and gotchas.

### Creating quests

Quests are how you interact with beacons think actions/tasks in other c2s.

Quests by default are group actions so scaling your activity is easy and built-in.

Each quest is made up of three main parts:

- Beacons - What you'll be executing on
- Tomes - What you'll be executing
- Input parameters - arguments passed to the tome and eldritch interpreter as `input_params{}`

#### To start click "Create new quest"

First you'll be prompted to select beacons you want this quest to apply to.

Beacons can be searched by name, group tag, and service tag.

Just start typing what you're looking for and Tavern will search across all three fields.

Now you can select individual beacons or use the "Select all" button to add everything that matches your search criteria.

*Note: `Service + group` searches are and'd while `service + service` or `group + group` searches are or'd.*

#### Next select the tome you want to run

Tomes can be searched by name

If the tome has parameters you'll be prompted. Consult the placeholder text if you're unsure how to format the input.

#### Finally review and confirm your quest

The final page gives an overview of what beacons, tome and parameters have been selected.

Lastly give your quest a descriptive name so you can reference back to it later if you need to lookup the information again. (We recommend this so you can avoid duplicating work and exposure on the system).
